### “This project is an end-to-end UPI Transaction Analytics & Risk Detection system.

I  started by designing a PostgreSQL database to store large-scale transactional data and performed SQL-based exploration to understand transaction volume, 
success rates, bank performance, merchant behavior, and time-based usage patterns.

Next, I used Python for data preprocessing and feature engineering, and built an ML-based anomaly detection pipeline using Isolation Forest to handle fully unlabeled transaction data. 
The model flagged around 3% high-risk transactions, generating explainable anomaly scores instead of just binary flags.

I then connected both SQL outputs and ML risk scores directly to Power BI, 
where I built 6 interactive dashboards covering transaction trends, bank and merchant performance, device behavior, and risk insights.

The final outcome is a business-ready monitoring system that allows stakeholders to track ₹300M+ in UPI transactions, 
quickly identify risk patterns, and drill down to suspicious transactions for faster decision-making.”
